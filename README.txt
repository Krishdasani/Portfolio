Krish Portfolio — Navy & Coral (Standalone)
=================================================

How to run
----------
Open `index.html` in your browser. No build tools required.

Customize
---------
- Replace the SVG placeholders in `/images` with your real screenshots (keep filenames).
- Update the two Live Demo links inside **index.html** if you have them for Sara’s Care and MHADA.
- Replace `krish_dasani_resume.pdf` with your actual CV (same filename).

Notes
-----
- Icons are inline SVG, so they work offline.
- Layout is responsive: 2 cards per row on tablet/desktop, 1 per row on phones.
- Footer is fixed; `.spacer` keeps content above the footer.
